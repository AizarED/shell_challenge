Note: What defines an anomaly is unclear. These are indexes (times) of datapoints near where strange behaviour is observed in various features.
These points in particular have only been identified because the behaviour of the asset near this point caused a shutdown in equipment, and so there are 
conceivably many more anomalies in the dataset that have not been identified as of yet, with each being possibly of a unique nature.
